# Testing Strategy for Prompt Partner

This document outlines the testing strategy for both the frontend React application and the backend API built with Node.js and SQLite. The goal is to ensure that both the user interface and API endpoints work reliably and meet the requirements for the MVP.

---

## 1. Overview

The testing strategy is divided into three primary areas:
- **Manual Testing:** Developer-led testing to verify functionality and user interactions.
- **Unit Testing:** Isolated tests for individual components and API functions.
- **Integration & End-to-End Testing:** Testing interactions between components and simulating real user scenarios.

## 2. Frontend Testing Strategy

### 2.1 Manual Testing
- **Objective:** Verify that the UI components (e.g., PromptList, PromptEditor, MasterPrompt, SelectedPromptList) work as expected.
- **Approach:**
  - Interact with the application in a web browser.
  - Confirm that prompts are fetched, added, edited, deleted, and combined correctly.
  - Validate clipboard operations and drag-and-drop reordering.

### 2.2 Unit Testing
- **Tools:** Jest and React Testing Library.
- **Objectives:**
  - Test individual React components for correct rendering, state updates, and event handling.
- **Examples:**
  - **PromptEditor:** Verify that form inputs capture user data and submit the correct values.
  - **MasterPrompt:** Confirm that the combined text is displayed properly and that clicking the "Copy" button triggers clipboard functionality.
  - **PromptList:** Check that prompts are rendered, and selection toggling works as intended.

### 2.3 Integration and End-to-End Testing
- **Tools:** Cypress (or a similar framework) for E2E testing.
- **Objectives:**
  - Simulate user workflows such as adding, editing, deleting prompts, and reordering selections.
  - Validate the complete flow from the frontend UI to backend API responses.
- **Approach:**
  - Automate user actions in a real browser environment.
  - Verify that UI changes reflect the underlying API data correctly.

## 3. Backend API Testing Strategy

### 3.1 Manual Testing
- **Tools:** Postman or cURL.
- **Objectives:**
  - Manually test all API endpoints (`GET /prompts`, `POST /prompts`, `PUT /prompts/:id`, `DELETE /prompts/:id`).
  - Validate correct HTTP status codes, response formats, and error handling for invalid inputs.

### 3.2 Unit Testing
- **Tools:** Jest and Supertest.
- **Objectives:**
  - Write tests for individual API routes to ensure proper handling of valid and invalid data.
  - Verify that database operations (using SQLite) return expected results.
- **Examples:**
  - **POST /prompts:** Ensure a new prompt is created with valid data and returns a new prompt ID.
  - **GET /prompts:** Verify that prompts are returned in the expected order (newest first).
  - **PUT /prompts/:id:** Confirm that an update modifies the intended prompt.
  - **DELETE /prompts/:id:** Validate that a prompt is successfully removed from the database.

### 3.3 Integration Testing
- **Objectives:**
  - Test the complete API flow by chaining operations (create, retrieve, update, delete) using a temporary or in-memory test database.
- **Approach:**
  - Set up a separate testing configuration to ensure tests do not interfere with production data.
  - Run a sequence of API calls and verify the system’s behavior.

### 3.4 (Optional) Performance and Load Testing
- **Tools:** Apache Benchmark (ab) or similar tools.
- **Objective:**
  - Evaluate the API’s performance under concurrent requests and identify any potential bottlenecks.

## 4. Testing Environment Setup

### Frontend
- **Dependencies:** Ensure that `jest`, `@testing-library/react`, and related packages are installed.
- **Scripts:** Add or update test scripts in `package.json` (for example, `"test": "react-scripts test"`).
- **Running Tests:** Execute `npm test` in the frontend directory.

### Backend
- **Dependencies:** Install `jest`, `supertest`, and any necessary mocking libraries.
- **Scripts:** Add or update test scripts in the backend `package.json` (for example, `"test": "jest"`).
- **Running Tests:** Execute `npm test` in the backend directory.
- **Note:** Use a separate test database configuration to avoid data conflicts with the production environment.

---

## 5. Future Considerations

- **Continuous Integration:** Integrate with CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions) to run tests automatically on pushes or pull requests.
- **Code Coverage:** Utilize tools like Istanbul/nyc to monitor code coverage.
- **User Feedback:** Adapt and expand test cases based on real-world usage and reported issues.

This testing strategy provides a comprehensive plan to ensure the reliability and quality of the Prompt Partner application. By combining manual, unit, integration, and optional performance tests, we lay a strong foundation for both immediate quality assurance and future scalability.
